# Hospital Executive Success Metrics for EHR Implementation

## Purpose
This document defines how each C-suite executive measures success for EHR implementations - from project kickoff through go-live and optimization. Use this to:
1. **Build features** into TNG platform to track these metrics automatically
2. **Include in SOWs** to define success criteria upfront with each stakeholder
3. **Obtain endorsements** when metrics prove success by their definition

| **EHR (Epic/Cerner)** | User logins, documentation time, order entry, chart closure | CIO, CMIO, CNO |
| **Revenue Cycle** | Days in A/R, clean claim rate, charge capture | CFO |
| **HR/Workforce** | Turnover, satisfaction surveys, training completion | CEO, CNO |
| **Quality/Safety** | Falls, HAIs, readmissions, core measures | CEO, CMIO, CNO |
| **Help Desk** | Ticket volume, resolution time, user issues | CIO, CTO |
| **Infrastructure** | Uptime, response time, security events | CTO |
