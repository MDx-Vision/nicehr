    <p>Welcome to The NICEHR Group, LLC ("Company"). We are a healthcare IT consulting firm specializing in Electronic Health Record (EHR) implementations, Technical Dress Rehearsals (TDR), go-live support, and technical services for healthcare organizations nationwide.</p>
    <p>This Employee Handbook ("Handbook") establishes the policies, procedures, and expectations that govern your employment. <strong>This Handbook is not a contract of employment and does not create any contractual rights.</strong> The Company reserves the right to modify, revoke, suspend, or add to any policy at any time, with or without notice.</p>

    <h1>2. EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP</h1>

    <h2>2.1 At-Will Employment</h2>
    <p>Your employment with the Company is "at-will." This means that either you or the Company may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. No supervisor, manager, or representative of the Company has the authority to enter into any agreement for employment for any specified period of time or to make any agreement contrary to the at-will nature of your employment, unless such agreement is in writing and signed by an authorized officer of the Company.</p>

    <h2>2.3 Project-Based Employment</h2>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1>3. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY</h1>

    <p>This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation, benefits, and training.</p>
    <p>Employees who believe they have been subjected to discrimination or harassment should immediately report the conduct to their supervisor, Human Resources, or any member of management.

    <h1>4. COMPENSATION AND PAYROLL</h1>

    <h2>4.1 Pay Schedule</h2>
    <p>Employees are paid bi-weekly on Fridays for the two-week period ending the previous Saturday. If a payday falls on a holiday, payment will be made on the preceding business day.</p>

    <h2>4.2 Overtime</h2>
    <p>Non-exempt employees will be paid one and one-half times (1.5×) their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek. <strong>All overtime must be pre-approved by your supervisor or project manager.</strong> Working unauthorized overtime may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>

    <h2>4.3 Per Diem Rates</h2>
    <p>Per diem is provided to offset costs associated with working away from home. Rates are based on distance from employee's home to the work site:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Tier</th>
            <th>Distance from Home</th>

            <td>Training periods only</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Per diem is paid for actual days worked and is subject to verification. Misrepresentation of per diem eligibility is grounds for termination.</p>

    <h2>4.4 Direct Deposit</h2>
    <p>All employees must enroll in direct deposit. A completed Direct Deposit Authorization Form with a voided check or bank verification letter is required prior to processing the first payroll. Changes to direct deposit information require 5 business days notice.</p>

    <h2>4.5 Tax Withholding</h2>
    <p>Employees must complete Form W-4 (Employee's Withholding Certificate) and applicable state tax forms upon hire. You are responsible for ensuring your withholding information is accurate and up to date. Changes to W-4 should be submitted to HR and take effect on the next available payroll.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h1>5. WORK HOURS AND ATTENDANCE</h1>

    <h2>5.1 Standard Work Week</h2>
    <p>The standard work week is forty (40) hours, typically Monday through Friday. However, actual schedules are determined by client requirements and may include early mornings, evenings, weekends, or holidays, particularly during go-live support periods.</p>

    <h2>5.2 Attendance and Punctuality</h2>
    <p>Regular attendance and punctuality are essential to successful project delivery. You must report to work as scheduled and remain at work for your entire shift. If you cannot report to work or will be late, you must notify your supervisor as soon as possible, and no later than one (1) hour before your scheduled start time.</p>

    <h2>5.3 No-Call, No-Show</h2>
    <p>Failure to report to work without proper notification for two (2) consecutive scheduled workdays will be considered job abandonment and voluntary resignation. The Company will process your separation accordingly.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1>6. TIME REPORTING AND TIMESHEETS</h1>
