# Software Patent Research for Healthcare IT

## NiceHR Patent Assessment Guide

**Prepared:** January 18, 2026
**Purpose:** Research findings on software patentability for healthcare IT applications

---

## 1. Prior Art Search (What Attorneys Do)

### Purpose
Determine if your invention is truly novel before spending money on a full patent application.

### What They Search
- USPTO patent database (granted patents + applications)
- International patent databases
- Scientific literature and trade journals
- Existing products in the market
- Any publicly available information

### Modern Tools
AI-powered patent search tools have reduced search time by up to 80%. Tools like [NLPatent](https://www.nlpatent.com/) and others use machine learning to find relevant prior art faster.

### Cost
$500 - $2,000 for a professional prior art search

### Why It Matters
A thorough search helps you:
- Avoid wasting money on unpatentable ideas
- Build stronger patent claims by knowing what's already out there
- Identify potential infringement risks

## 2. Patentability Assessment (The Alice Test)

### The Four Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Novelty** | Is it new? |
| **Non-Obviousness** | Would it be obvious to someone skilled in the field? |
| **Utility** | Is it useful? |
| **Subject Matter Eligibility** | Does it solve a *technical* problem (not just a business problem)? |

### The Alice Test (Critical for Software)

Since [Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank (2014)](https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/patent-policy/patent-subject-matter-eligibility), software patents must pass a two-step test:

1. Is the claim directed to an "abstract idea"?
2. If yes, does it include an "inventive concept" that transforms it into something patentable?

### What Makes Software Patentable

**Patentable:**
- Improves computer functionality (speed, efficiency, resource usage)
- Solves a technical problem in an unconventional way
- Specific algorithms with technical improvements

**NOT Patentable:**
- Generic business processes automated by a computer
- Abstract ideas without technical implementation

### 2025 USPTO Updates

The [August 2025 USPTO guidance](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2231/2024-07-24-understanding-2024-uspto-guidance-update-ai-patent) provides clearer pathways for AI/ML inventions, establishing more precise boundaries between abstract ideas and practical applications.

## 3. Healthcare IT Specific Considerations

### Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)

If your software provides information "significant" to making healthcare decisions, it may qualify as a medical device under FDA regulations AND be patent-eligible.

### EHR/Healthcare Software Patents That Have Been Granted

| Patent Number | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| [US7801740B1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7801740B1/en) | Medical records creation software with billing code automation |
| [US20130110547A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20130110547A1/en) | EHR/EMR system integration across legacy HIT systems |
| [US20140046940A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140046940) | Medical treatment management for tracking patient care |

### What's Patentable in Healthcare IT

- Novel algorithms for patient matching/scheduling
- Unique data processing methods for EHR interoperability
- AI/ML models for diagnosis assistance or treatment optimization
- Specific technical implementations of compliance workflows

## 4. The Patent Filing Process

### Option A: Provisional Patent Application

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Cost** | $1,500 - $3,000 (attorney fees) + $65-$320 (USPTO filing fee) |
| **Timeline** | Establishes priority date immediately |
| **Duration** | 12 months of "Patent Pending" status |
| **What You Get** | Filing date protection while you develop the full application |

**Critical:** You MUST file a non-provisional within 12 months or lose priority.

### Option B: Non-Provisional (Utility) Patent Application

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Cost** | $8,000 - $18,000+ (complex software can exceed $25,000) |
| **Timeline** | 2-3 years average for examination and approval |
| **Expedited Option** | Track One Prioritized Examination (additional ~$1,000-$4,000) |

### What the Application Needs

- Detailed algorithms and flowcharts
- Technical specifications
- Claims that focus on technical improvements (not business benefits)
- Descriptions enabling someone skilled in the art to reproduce

### USPTO Fee Structure

| Applicant Type | Provisional Filing Fee |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Micro Entity | $65 |
| Small Entity | $160 |
| Large Entity | $320 |

### Questions for Patent Attorney

1. Does our TDR module's workflow constitute a patentable "technical improvement"?
2. Can our consultant matching algorithm be protected?
3. Is the ESIGN 4-step wizard novel enough for patent protection?
4. Should we file multiple provisional patents or one comprehensive application?
5. What's the realistic timeline and total cost for our situation?
