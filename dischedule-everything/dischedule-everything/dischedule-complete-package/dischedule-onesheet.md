## Build Better Teams. Deliver Better Results.

---

### The Problem

Assembling project teams is often guesswork. Managers match skills to requirements but overlook how people actually work together. The result? Communication breakdowns, personality clashes, and underperforming teams—even when individual talent is strong.

**The cost of getting it wrong:**
- 70% of project failures stem from team dynamics, not technical gaps
- Misaligned teams experience 40% more conflict and delays
- Employee turnover spikes when people feel mismatched to their teams

---

### The Solution

**DiSChedule** combines behavioral science with intelligent scheduling to build teams that don't just have the right skills—they have the right chemistry.

Using the proven DiSC behavioral assessment framework, DiSChedule analyzes how team members will communicate, collaborate, and perform together *before* you make assignments.
