## Overview

### What is Drill-Down?

Drill-down allows users to click on summary metrics to see underlying detailed data.

```
Level 1: KPI Card          "15 Open Deals - $500K"
            │
            ▼ click
Level 2: Filtered List     [Table of 15 deals with details]
            │
            ▼ click row
Level 3: Detail View       [Single deal with full info]
            │
            ▼ click related
Level 4: Related Data      [Activities, contacts, history]
```

---

## Technical Approach

### Drill-Down Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Navigate to Filtered Page
```typescript
// Click handler navigates with query params
const handleDrillDown = () => {
  navigate(`/crm/deals?status=open&stage=${stageId}`);
};
```

#### Pattern 2: Slide-Out Panel
```typescript
// Show detail panel without leaving page
const [drillDownData, setDrillDownData] = useState(null);
const [showPanel, setShowPanel] = useState(false);

const handleDrillDown = (data) => {
  setDrillDownData(data);
  setShowPanel(true);
};
```

#### Pattern 3: Modal Detail View
```typescript
// Show modal with detailed breakdown
const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);
const [modalContent, setModalContent] = useState(null);

const handleDrillDown = (item) => {
  setModalContent(item);
  setShowModal(true);
};
```

#### Pattern 4: Expandable Row
```typescript
// Table row expands to show detail
const [expandedRow, setExpandedRow] = useState(null);

const handleRowClick = (rowId) => {
  setExpandedRow(expandedRow === rowId ? null : rowId);
};
```

### Reusable Components to Create

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `DrillDownCard` | Stat card with click handler |
| `DrillDownChart` | Chart wrapper with point click |
| `DrillDownPanel` | Slide-out detail panel |
| `DrillDownModal` | Modal for detailed view |
| `DrillDownTable` | Table with expandable rows |

### Data Requirements

Each drill-down needs:
1. **Source data** - What metric/chart triggers it
2. **Target data** - What detailed data to show
3. **Filter context** - How to filter the detail view
4. **Navigation** - URL or component to show
