Summary:

Project Creation & Hospital Details

The process begins with creating a project when a hospital hires NICEHR.
Each project will include hospital details, the number of hospital staff, required consultants, and the project duration.
Hospital details are maintained in a separate module.
Each hospital has multiple departments (Units), and each Unit consists of various Modules.
Each Module has specific consultant requirements.
A dedicated Consultant Module will store all necessary consultant information.
Scheduling & Approval Process

Once a project is created, an automated schedule should run for the entire project duration.
The schedule will map consultants with hospital staff to their designated positions within specific Modules and Units.
The NICEHR Admin Team must review and approve the schedule.
Any change requests, including swaps or retractions from scheduled positions, will be handled by the Admin Team.
Budget / Savings Calculator

Hospitals may initially estimate a requirement of, for example, 1000 consultants.
The system will assess the actual number of consultants needed based on Modules, Units, and hospital staffing knowledge.
The calculator will also evaluate cost savings by factoring in consultant pay rates and expenses (e.g., flights, accommodation, per diem).
Example: If 1000 consultants are initially estimated, the system will optimize the allocation and identify potential savings, such as reducing consultant travel costs. 
ROI Dashboard

Hospital staff will answer a set of questions related to their learning experience and feedback regarding consultant support.
Based on these responses, calculations will be performed to generate key performance metrics.
The ROI Dashboard will display these insights and will be accessible to hospital leadership for decision-making.
Action Items:

NiceHR Team: To share a detailed document covering both hospital and consultant requirements.
JS Team: To review the document thoroughly.
Next Step: After the review, the JS Team will schedule a follow-up call to discuss the details further.
